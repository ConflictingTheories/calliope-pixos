# Pixospritz - Callbacks Specification

## Introduction
The purpose of callbacks is to provide common snippets of code which can be run from a single declaration and helps to avoid rewriting and duplicating logic across common objects or situations. They tend to be the most reuseable pieces and it anticipated that a variety of namespace derived callback libraries may be easily established. 

By using a namespace to encapsulate the various callbacks it allows for a library to be established with relative ease. This is extremely important when working within larger pixospritz that caution be exercised when handling global namespace callbacks.

For the basic example include, global namespace callbacks are employed for simplicity and ease of understanding, but not for security or programming correctness.
