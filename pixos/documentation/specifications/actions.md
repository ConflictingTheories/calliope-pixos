# Pixospritz - Actions Specification

## Introduction
Actions represent the core interactions which happen within the games or scenes. These are effectively the logical things which can be done in standard way.

There are a core set of supported actions which form the main set of logic for the Pixospritz experiences, however, there is the possibility for extended functionality in unofficial players which could support extra actions.

Actions are different from triggers and callbacks in that they are pretermined functionality of the game engine.

The currently supported actions are as follows:

- `animate`
- `changezone`
- `chat`
- `dance`
- `face`
- `greeting`
- `interact`
- `move`
- `patrol`
- `prompt`
- `script`
