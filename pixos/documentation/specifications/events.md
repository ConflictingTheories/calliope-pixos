# Pixospritz - Events Specification

## Introduction
Events are very similar to actions except that they are run outside of the core action queue and have their own queue. These tend to be functions which sometimes need to run during other actions or outside of the main flow.

The currently support Events are:

- `camera`
- `menu`
- `chat`
