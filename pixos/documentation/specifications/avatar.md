# Pixospritz - Avatar Specification

## Introduction
The Avatar represents the player character themselves. It may refer to multiple "sprites" in the game world, and the user may or may not continue to represent a legeacy character or may instead embody a new character each time. Much like in tabletop games, players sometimes run longer campaigns and at other times play opt to play a one-off game with a single short storyline and completely random characters. In all these cases, they still represent their avatar and that avatar is making actions, interacting with the world, and causing events to occur.

Some players may try to continue to use the same "player character" as their avatar, but in all cases, the avatar in these documents will refer to the conceptual entity and control point rather than refer to any particular character or sprite. In different games, additional actions and skills maybe available to the player's avatar to perform, but in all cases, those will typically be interfaced through the common means which the avatar can be controlled.
